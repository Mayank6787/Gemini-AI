# Here is your AI Chatbot !!! 



I created a Gemini AI bot clone using the Gemini API to deepen my understanding of API integration within a React.js environment.
This project allowed me to explore and implement key React concepts such as the Context API and the useState hook, enhancing my skills as a JavaScript developer.

The use of the Context API facilitated global state management across different components, while the useState hook enabled dynamic and responsive user interactions. 
By working on this project, I not only improved my ability to integrate APIs into React applications but also gained valuable experience in building scalable, maintainable, and efficient front-end code.
